## 1️⃣ Interest of Content

The project, *Computing for Good*, presents a clear and meaningful theme: showcasing how computing contributes positively to society through **healthcare**, **education**, and **environmental sustainability**.  
Each topic page has distinct focus areas with relevant examples, such as AI-driven diagnostics, personalized learning, and environmental monitoring using IoT.  

The content is engaging and demonstrates good understanding of how technology impacts real-world challenges. The index page introduces the topic effectively and invites users to explore further through simple and logical navigation.

**💡 Suggestions:**  
- Consider adding short “real-world impact” metrics (e.g., “AI diagnostics reduce error rates by X%”) to make content more data-informed.  
- Add one or two cross-page links (e.g., from healthcare to education) to strengthen thematic coherence.

## 2️⃣ Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation

The visual presentation is **clean, modern, and consistent** across all pages.  
Using **Bootstrap 5** ensures responsive layout and uniform typography. Navigation works smoothly, and all pages maintain similar design elements — consistent margins, colour palette, and card layout.

The home page hero section is especially effective, with a clear headline and supporting visual (hero image). Author cards are neatly styled with avatars, making the site feel personal and professional.

**💡 Suggestions:**  
- Use a consistent aspect ratio for all topic images to avoid layout shifts.  
- Add hover highlights or “active” state to the navbar to indicate the current page.

## 3️⃣ Quality of Written Presentation

Writing throughout the website is clear, grammatically correct, and professional.  
Each page’s tone is factual yet engaging. The author bios are written in the third person (by another member), which fulfills the assignment’s collaboration criterion.  

The content demonstrates balanced academic writing and web readability — short paragraphs, bulleted lists, and descriptive headings.

**💡 Suggestions:**  
- Consider adding a short introductory paragraph at the top of each topic page summarizing its focus.  
- Minor stylistic improvement: avoid overusing capital letters in headings.

## 4️⃣ Validity of HTML and Technical Implementation

The HTML structure is valid and easy to read.  
- Proper use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` sections;  
- All tags appear properly closed;  
- The site loads correctly both locally and via GitHub Pages.  
Bootstrap and CSS links are correctly referenced via CDN.  
All relative paths (especially from subpages to `assets/`) are functional.

**💡 Suggestions:**  
- Add `<meta description>` tags for accessibility and SEO;  
- Ensure all images have `alt` attributes;  
- Consider adding a favicon for a polished final touch.

## 5️⃣ Evidence of Collaboration

This project shows **strong evidence of genuine collaboration**:
- Each content page is clearly authored by a different member.  
- Author bios are written by others (as required).  
- Git history indicates multiple contributors and incremental commits.  
- The consistent design suggests shared discussion of layout and theme.  

The inclusion of a “Demonstrator” section acknowledging team guidance is a nice professional touch.

**💡 Suggestions:**  
- Encourage each contributor to make smaller, descriptive commits (e.g., `fix: update nav links in education page`) for clarity in collaboration history.  
- Add a short “Team credits” or “Version history” section at the bottom of `README.md` to summarize contributions.

## ✅ Overall Assessment
